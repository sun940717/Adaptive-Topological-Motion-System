# ATMS System Overview

This document describes the high-level operational structure of the Adaptive Topological Motion System (ATMS).

It focuses on how morphologies are initialized, combined, and prepared for action generation.

## Morphology Initialization

ATMS allows morphologies to originate from both structured and unstructured states.

### Undifferentiated Initialization

When a morphology lacks distinct or identifiable features, it is treated as an undifferentiated morphology.

In such cases, ATMS initializes the entity by distributing latent nodes uniformly or quasi-uniformly across the available form space.

This establishes a minimal topological substrate without imposing predefined structure.

---

## Morphology Combination and Inheritance

ATMS supports the combination of multiple morphologies through inheritance events.

These events do not imply biological reproduction, but topological recombination.

---

### Inheritance Process

During an inheritance event:

1. Parent morphologies contribute features rather than complete structures.
2. Features are decomposed into transferable components.
3. Components are redistributed stochastically across the descendant topology.
4. Redistribution respects topological validity and system constraints.

This process prevents rigid template inheritance and enables emergent structure.

---

## Feature Redistribution Rules

- Feature allocation is randomized within constrained bounds.
- No guarantee is made that inherited features remain localized.
- Global traits may fragment into distributed characteristics.
- Local traits may aggregate into new structural motifs.

The system prioritizes coherence over preservation.

## Role of Learning Systems

ATMS does not mandate manual rule execution.

Machine learning systems may be employed as proposal mechanisms to generate candidate morphologies or feature distributions.

However, all proposals must pass through ATMS constraint enforcement before acceptance.

Learning systems operate within the bounds defined by ATMS, not in place of them.

## Separation of Responsibilities

- Morphology generation defines *what exists*.
- ATMS defines *how it may act*.
- Learning systems define *what is proposed*.

This separation ensures extensibility and interpretability.

---

## Summary

ATMS treats form as mutable, inheritance as redistributive, and learning as constrained.

These principles allow the system to support unlimited morphological variation while maintaining coherence and continuity.
